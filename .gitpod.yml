##
## This '.gitpod.yml' file when placed at the root of a project instructs
## Gitpod how to prepare & build the project, start development environments
## and configure continuous prebuilds. Prebuilds when enabled builds a project
## like a CI server so you can start coding right away - no more waiting for
## dependencies to download and builds to finish when reviewing pull-requests
## or hacking on something new.
##
## With Gitpod you can develop software from any device (even iPads) via 
## desktop or browser based versions of VS Code or any JetBrains IDE and
## customise it to your individual needs - from themes to extensions, you
## have full control.
##
## The easiest way to try out Gitpod is install the browser extenion:
## 'https://www.gitpod.io/docs/browser-extension' or by prefixing
## 'https://gitpod.io#' to the source control URL of any project.
##
## For example: 'https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod'

## The optional 'additionalRepositories' key is an array of repositories
## which contains two properties which define the source control `url` to
## clone and the `checkoutLocation` of where the repository is cloned
## under `/workspaces`
##
## Learn more at 'https://www.gitpod.io/docs/multi-repo-workspaces'

additionalRepositories:
  - url: https://github.com/orx0815/peregrine-cms
     # checkoutLocation is optional and relative to /workspaces.
     # by default the location defaults to the repository name.
    checkoutLocation: peregrine
  - url: https://github.com/orx0815/themeclean-flex
    checkoutLocation: themeclean-flex

## The 'tasks' section defines how Gitpod prepares and builds this project
## or how Gitpod can start development servers. With Gitpod, there are three
## types of tasks:
##
## - before: Use this for tasks that need to run before init and before command. 
## - init: Use this to configure prebuilds of heavy-lifting tasks such as
##         downloading dependencies or compiling source code.
## - command: Use this to start your database or application when the workspace starts.
##
